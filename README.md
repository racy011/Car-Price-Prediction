# Car-Price-Prediction
This code demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a car price prediction model using linear regression. It begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset for exploration. It checks for missing values, duplicates, and performs data cleaning, such as extracting the company name and removing the owner column. The OneHotEncoder is used to encode categorical features like car name, fuel type, and transmission. The dataset is split into training and test sets, followed by training a linear regression model. Evaluation is done using R-squared score, and the model predicts car prices for new data. This process highlights data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in machine learning.
